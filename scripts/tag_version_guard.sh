# Taken from Bespok3d/material-tags, which is where this guard was written. It is kept byte for byte
# the same apart from this note: a guard that drifts per repo is a guard nobody can reason about, and
# the manifest search below already finds a plugin at any of the three depths a repo might use.
#
# Guard: a `plugin-<name>-v<version>` release tag must name a plugin this repo holds, at the exact
# version that plugin's manifest declares.
#
# The release workflow fires on the tag, but everything it publishes is stamped from manifest.json:
# the package filename, the GitHub release, and the index atom the app reads to learn a newer
# version exists. A tag whose number disagrees therefore publishes a package the tag lies about, and
# the disagreement is invisible afterwards. Refuse the run instead.
#
# Refusing a ref that is not a release tag at all is the same guard from the other side: that is
# what a run off a branch looks like, and a branch must never publish.
