# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (in development)

First version. Not released: no tag has been pushed and nothing has been published.

- The plugin installs, starts a supervised service on port 8095, and serves its own page through its
  own nginx location.
- Every endpoint that reads or writes the schedule sits behind Moonraker's `/access/user`, so the
  scheduler is exactly as reachable as the rest of the printer's web interface and no more.
- `/health` is deliberately not behind it, because an endpoint that needs a working Moonraker to
  answer is useless for diagnosing a broken one.
- The decision engine is in place and tested: the schedule store, the printer client, and the rule
  table that decides whether a job starts. It is not wired to anything yet, so the plugin still
  cannot start a print, and `/jobs` answers with an empty list because there is nothing to list
  rather than because nothing is scheduled.
- On a printer that offers it, a job's bed mesh and timelapse choices are carried by
  `SDCARD_PRINT_FILE_WITH_PARAMETERS`, the same command the printer's own interface uses, so a
  scheduled print behaves like one started by hand. Elsewhere, Moonraker's own print start is used
  and those choices have nothing to act on.
