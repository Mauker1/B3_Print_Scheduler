# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (in development)

First version. Not released: no tag has been pushed and nothing has been published.

- The plugin installs, starts a supervised service on port 8095, and serves its own page through its
  own nginx location.
- Every endpoint that reads or writes the schedule sits behind Moonraker's `/access/user`, so the
  scheduler is exactly as reachable as the rest of the printer's web interface and no more.
- `/health` is deliberately not behind it, because an endpoint that needs a working Moonraker to
  answer is useless for diagnosing a broken one.
- Scheduling itself is not built yet. `/jobs` answers with an empty list because there is nothing to
  list, not because nothing is scheduled.
